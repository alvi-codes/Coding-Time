# **My Programming Repository**

Hello, <br>
I am Alvi, a Computer Engineering student from Imperial College London, and this is my public programming repository on GitHub. Here, I upload all my C++ and Python codes for others to learn from or use as reference.

## **C++ Programs**

I have a strong knowledge of C++, including data structures and object-oriented programming (OOP). I have implemented various algorithms and data structures in C++, such as: <br>
* Arrays 
* Vectors
* Linked Lists
* Stacks and Queues
* Trees (Binary Search Trees, etc.)
* Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
* Dynamic programming

I have also worked with advanced C++ features, such as:

* Exception handling
* File handling
* Standard Template Library (STL)

## **Visual Basic .NET Programs**
The Visual Basic .NET folder contains my early projects and exercises in this programming language.

VB.NET is an object-oriented, event-driven language developed by Microsoft as a successor to classic Visual Basic language, and is part of the .NET framework. I learned VB.NET as my first programming language and explored data structures, file handling, and OOP concepts. These projects showcase my understanding of the language and provide a reference for those interested in learning VB.NET.
